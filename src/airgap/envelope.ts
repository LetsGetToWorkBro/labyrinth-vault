/**
 * The wire between the two halves, which is a camera pointed at a screen.
 *
 * Labyrinth Vault is a phone with no network. The only thing that crosses
 * between it and the online half is light: one device draws a QR code, the
 * other reads it. That makes this file the entire attack surface of the
 * airgap, and the reason it is written before any user interface.
 *
 * Four things it has to do, and the fourth is the one that matters.
 *
 *   1. Carry more than fits. A QR code holds a couple of kilobytes at a
 *      density a phone camera reads reliably across a room-lit table. A
 *      Bitcoin PSBT is a few kilobytes and a Monero unsigned transaction set
 *      can be tens, so a payload is cut into parts and played as a sequence.
 *
 *   2. Say what it is. A part names the payload type and the format version,
 *      so a device can refuse a thing it does not understand rather than
 *      guess at it.
 *
 *   3. Arrive out of order. A camera catches frames as it happens to catch
 *      them: parts turn up shuffled and repeated, and the reader has to cope
 *      without asking for anything, because there is no back channel. This
 *      is a one-way pipe by construction.
 *
 *   4. Refuse to assemble something that is not what was sent. Every part
 *      carries the digest of the *whole* payload, and assembly recomputes it.
 *      A single flipped bit, a part from a different transaction that happens
 *      to have the same index, a partially-updated screen caught mid-refresh:
 *      all of them fail closed. On this wire, silently assembling the wrong
 *      bytes means signing the wrong transaction, so "fail closed" is not
 *      defensive programming, it is the product.
 *
 * The text is deliberately upper-case and digits only. QR has an alphanumeric
 * mode covering exactly that set, and it stores roughly 1.55 bits per
 * character against binary mode's 8 bits per byte: base32 in alphanumeric
 * mode beats raw binary for the same payload, and the codes come out sparser
 * and easier for a cheap camera on an old phone. Which is the whole premise
 * of the product: the phone in your drawer is the vault.
 *
 * Interoperating with desktop Bitcoin wallets means also speaking BC-UR
 * (`ur:crypto-psbt`), which Sparrow, Electrum and the hardware signers use.
 * That is an encoder over this same chunk-and-verify core rather than a
 * different design; see docs/airgap-protocol.md.
 *
 * No imports, no platform. This runs in Node under test, in a browser, and
 * inside a React Native bridge without changing.
