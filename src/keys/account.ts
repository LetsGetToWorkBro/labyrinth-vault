/**
 * The watch-only export: the one thing this device ever sends first.
 *
 * Everything else that crosses the gap is a reply. This is the handshake: the
 * vault makes a key, and the companion needs enough to watch the chain for it
 * and build transactions, and not one bit more than that.
 *
 * ## What is being handed over, and what it costs
 *
 * For Bitcoin, an account zpub. For Monero, the primary address and the
 * private *view* key. Neither can spend. Both can watch, and watching is not
 * nothing: whoever holds them sees every payment that wallet ever receives,
 * and for Bitcoin an account zpub links every address in the wallet together
 * forever. That is the trade a watch-only companion is, and it should be said
 * out loud rather than buried, because the companion is the networked device
 * and the one most likely to be compromised.
 *
 * What it is not is a way to lose money. An attacker with this learns what you
 * have. An attacker with the seed phrase takes it.
 *
 * ## Why JSON
 *
 * The payload is small, it crosses once, and the thing reading it is a
 * full computer rather than this phone. A compact binary encoding would save a
 * few hundred bytes on a payload that already fits in one QR code, at the cost
 * of being undebuggable by a person holding the two devices and wondering why
 * they will not talk. The envelope around it already provides the framing and
 * the checksum, so this layer only has to be legible.
