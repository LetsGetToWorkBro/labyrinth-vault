/**
 * Bitcoin keys and addresses. BIP84 throughout.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling project, minus everything that touches a network.
 * What is left is the half a vault is allowed to have: turn a seed phrase into
 * an account key, turn an account key into addresses, and say whether a string
 * somebody typed is really an address. The scanning, the fee estimates and the
 * coin selection all live on the companion, which is the device that is
 * allowed to know what a blockchain is.
 *
 * One standard, done properly: 12 words, m/84'/0'/0', bech32 (bc1q) addresses.
 * Every mainstream wallet since 2018 restores from it, which matters more here
 * than it did there. If this device is lost, the phrase has to be enough on its
 * own, in software that is not ours, years from now.
 *
 * The cryptography is @scure/bip39, @scure/bip32 and @scure/btc-signer:
 * audited, minimal, MIT. What is written here is the assembly, and `selfTest`
 * checks that assembly against the vector published in BIP84 itself.
 *
 * ## No platform
 *
 * Nothing in this file reaches for `crypto.getRandomValues`, a filesystem, or
 * a global. Randomness is an argument. That keeps the file testable, keeps it
 * identical under Node, a browser and a React Native bridge, and means the
 * question "where did this key's entropy come from?" has an answer at the call
 * site rather than three layers down.
