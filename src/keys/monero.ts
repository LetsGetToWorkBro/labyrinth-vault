/**
 * Monero keys, addresses and seed phrases.
 *
 * ## Why this file argues against itself
 *
 * Key generation is a genuinely dangerous thing to write. Almost everything
 * else fails loudly: a broken image encoder produces a broken image. This
 * fails silently and expensively. A derivation that is wrong by one operation
 * produces a perfectly well-formed address whose funds nobody can ever reach,
 * and it is indistinguishable from a correct one until somebody has already
 * sent money to it.
 *
 * Being offline does not fix that. An airgap protects a key from being
 * exfiltrated; it does nothing about a key that was wrong when it was made.
 * So the checks below exist so that "verify it yourself" is something a person
 * can actually do rather than advice we give them.
 *
 * ## What is trusted, and what is checked
 *
 * No cryptography is written here. Keccak-256 comes from @noble/hashes and the
 * ed25519 group arithmetic from @noble/curves, both audited. What is written
 * here is the part that is Monero's rather than cryptography's: scalar
 * reduction, the key derivation, the address encoding, and the seed phrase.
 *
 * Those are checked four ways, and `selfTest()` runs all of them on the device
 * before it will make a key:
 *
 *   1. **Keccak-256 against published vectors.** If the hash is wrong every
 *      view key and every checksum is wrong.
 *   2. **The ed25519 base point.** G*1 has one correct encoding and everybody
 *      publishes it.
 *   3. **A real address, made by the official implementation.** Decoding a
 *      known-good address, re-deriving its checksum and re-encoding it back to
 *      the identical characters exercises base58 both ways and Keccak, and it
 *      is a cross-check against software that is not ours.
 *   4. **Round trips.** A phrase encodes and decodes to the same bytes; an
 *      address encodes and decodes to the same keys.
 *
 * What none of that can prove is that the private-to-public step is right,
 * because there is no published secret to test it against and inventing one
 * proves nothing. So the instruction that goes with this code, and it is worth
 * repeating wherever it surfaces, is to restore the phrase in the official
 * Monero wallet and confirm it shows the same address **before** anything is
 * sent to it. That check uses an independent implementation, which is the only
 * kind of proof that counts.
 *
 * Ported from the sibling project, which is where the tests came from too. The
 * derivation is deliberately unchanged: it has been checked against the
 * official wallet, and "tidying" it here would throw that away.

 *
 * That asymmetry is the entire reason a vault and a companion can be two
 * different devices. The private *view* key finds incoming outputs; the
 * private *spend* key authorizes spending. The companion gets the view key,
 * watches the chain and shows a balance, and cannot move a coin. The spend key
 * never leaves this device.
 *
 * It is not free, and anyone showing this to a person should say so: whoever
 * holds the view key sees every payment that address ever receives, forever.
 * That is a smaller secret than the spend key, not a public one, and the
 * companion phone is a networked device that has now been handed it.
