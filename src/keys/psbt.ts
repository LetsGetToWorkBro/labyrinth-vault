/**
 * Reading a transaction to a person, and only then signing it.
 *
 * This is the file the rest of the project exists to protect. Everything else
 * is transport: chunking, checksums, word tables. None of it decides anything.
 * Here is where an unsigned transaction arrives from a device that might be
 * compromised, gets turned into sentences somebody can read, and becomes a
 * signature or does not.
 *
 * ## The threat, stated plainly
 *
 * The online half builds the transaction. If it is compromised it can build a
 * *valid* one that pays somebody else. Every byte checks out. Every checksum
 * passes. The airgap does not help: it faithfully carries the attacker's
 * transaction across. So the question this file answers is not "did these
 * bytes arrive intact" but "what do these bytes actually do", and the answer
 * has to be legible to a tired person holding a phone.
 *
 * ## The attacks it is specifically built to stop
 *
 * **Lying about the change address.** A PSBT can mark an output as change,
 * with a derivation path, and a wallet that believes it shows "0.4 BTC back to
 * you" while the script pays the attacker. So `mine` here is never read from
 * the PSBT. Every output claimed as ours is re-derived from our own key and
 * the script compared. A mismatch is not a warning to scroll past, it is
 * fatal: the PSBT has been caught lying, and nothing it says can be trusted
 * afterwards.
 *
 * **Hiding the fee.** The fee is not written in a transaction; it is what is
 * left over, so a signer can only state it if it knows what every input was
 * worth, and it only knows that because the PSBT told it. A PSBT that omits
 * the previous outputs leaves the fee unknowable, and there is no honest way
 * to render "fee: probably fine" on a confirmation screen. So a missing input
 * value is fatal here rather than a blank field.
 *
 * Worth being precise about the neighboring attack rather than claiming to
 * stop it: a PSBT that *understates* an input amount does not steal anything
 * from this wallet, because a segwit signature commits to the amount, so a
 * wrong one produces a signature that simply does not verify. The danger is
 * the honest-looking transaction with a real and enormous fee, which is a
 * number on the screen for a person to read, not something to catch by
 * arithmetic.
 *
 * **Describing one transaction and signing another.** The screen a person
 * approved and the bytes that get signed have to be the same bytes. `signPsbt`
 * will not take a PSBT on its own: it takes the summary that was shown, and
 * checks that summary's digest against the bytes in front of it. A UI that
 * re-fetches, re-parses or re-orders between the two steps fails closed rather
 * than signing something nobody read.
 *
 * **Sighash games.** A PSBT can request a signature under SIGHASH_NONE, which
 * commits to the inputs and not the outputs: the screen shows a payment to
 * Dave, the person approves, and the resulting signature is equally valid on
 * a transaction paying anybody. The screen was honest and so was the
 * signature, about two different transactions. This wallet needs SIGHASH_ALL
 * and nothing else, so any other flag is fatal at describe time, and the
 * signing call pins ALL again underneath in case the description step is ever
 * bypassed.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not decide anything. There is no threshold above which it signs on
 * its own, and the warnings are not a substitute for the destination and the
 * amount being read. A person who approves without reading gets what they
 * approved. The most this file can do is make sure that what was on the screen
 * is what gets signed, and refuse in the cases where the screen would
 * necessarily be wrong.
