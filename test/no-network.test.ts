/**
 * The claim on the front of this project, checked instead of asserted.
 *
 * The README says the vault has no network code in it. That is the sentence
 * everything else rests on, and it is exactly the sort of sentence that is
 * true when it is written and false eighteen months later, after somebody adds
 * a price lookup "just for the confirmation screen" and nobody rereads the
 * README.
 *
 * So it is a test. It walks the actual source and fails on anything that could
 * open a socket, touch a browser API, or reach the filesystem. It is a coarse
 * check and it is meant to be: the point is not to catch a determined author,
 * it is to make the absence something CI notices, and to make adding one an
 * argument rather than an accident.
 *
 * If a future version genuinely needs one of these, the honest move is to
 * delete the entry here in the same commit and say why. Not to work around it.
