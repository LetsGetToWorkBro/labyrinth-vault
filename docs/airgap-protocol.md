# The airgap protocol

The only wire between the two halves of Labyrinth Vault is a camera pointed at
a screen. This document is what crosses it, and, more importantly, what that
does and does not protect you from.

## The two halves

**The vault** is a phone with no network. Ideally an old one in a drawer with
its SIM out and its radios off; the app never asks for a network permission,
so on iOS the absence is checkable in Settings rather than promised in
marketing. It holds the keys, and it is the only thing that ever sees them.

**The companion** is online: your everyday phone or a desktop wallet. It
watches the chain, builds unsigned transactions, and broadcasts finished ones.
It never holds a key and cannot spend anything on its own.

Neither half is much use alone, which is the point. Stealing the online device
gets an attacker a view of your balance. Stealing the vault gets them a brick
without your passphrase. Both, plus the passphrase, is the threat model any
hardware wallet has.

## What crosses

Seven payload kinds, named on the wire so a device can refuse what it does not
understand rather than guess:

| Kind | Direction | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ACCOUNT` | vault to companion | Watch-only export: an xpub/zpub, or a Monero view key and primary address |
| `PSBT` | companion to vault | An unsigned Bitcoin transaction |
| `TXSIGNED` | vault to companion | A finished, broadcastable transaction |
| `XMRUNSIGNED` | companion to vault | An unsigned Monero transaction set |
| `XMRSIGNED` | vault to companion | A signed Monero transaction set |
| `XMROUTPUTS` | companion to vault | The Monero outputs the wallet's scan found, asking for key images |
| `XMRKEYIMAGES` | vault to companion | One key image per output, so the wallet can see its own spends |

The last two are the Monero bookkeeping loop. A view key finds money arriving
and cannot see it leave; spends are named on the chain by key images, and
computing one takes the spend secret, which never leaves the vault. So the
wallet sends the outputs it found, the vault re-proves each one is really its
own before touching the spend key, and the images come back over the same
one-way light. The wallet accepts an image only for an output it actually
found, so a corrupted reply can at worst fail to mark a spend, never invent
one.

## The frame

One QR code carries one frame, and a frame is plain text:

```
LV1:PSBT:3:12:9f2a1c04:MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK...
│   │    │ │  │        └ this frame's slice of the payload, base32
│   │    │ │  └ digest of the WHOLE payload, CRC-32, hex
│   │    │ └ how many frames in total
│   │    └ this frame's number, from 1
│   └ payload kind
└ format, refused if it is not the version this build speaks
```

**Why base32 rather than base64 or raw bytes.** QR has an alphanumeric mode
covering upper-case letters and digits, and it spends about 1.55 bits per
character there against 8 bits per byte in binary mode. Base32 costs 8
characters per 5 bytes but each character is cheap, so the code comes out
sparser: bigger modules, read from further away, by the mediocre camera on a
seven-year-old phone. That is the premise of the product, so the wire is
optimized for it.

**Why 400 bytes a frame.** A version-20 QR at error correction M holds roughly
850 alphanumeric characters. 400 payload bytes is 640 characters of base32
plus a short header, which leaves room and keeps the modules large. A 40 KB
Monero transaction set becomes about a hundred frames: fifteen seconds of
animation, not a nice number, but an honest one.

## What the digest is for, and what it is not for

Every frame carries a CRC-32 of the entire payload. After the last frame
arrives, the receiver reassembles and recomputes it. If it does not match,
**everything is discarded** and the scan starts again. There is no "probably
fine" path, however long the person has been waving a phone at a screen.

This catches the accidents, which are the likely failures:

- a frame misread by one character,
- a screen caught mid-refresh,
- a scan of two different transactions merged because they had the same number
  of parts.

It does **not** catch an attacker, and cannot. CRC-32 is not a hash, and even
a real hash would not help: on a one-way optical wire, whoever controls the
online device can simply display a *valid* transaction that pays themselves.
Every byte would check out perfectly.

**So the confirmation screen is the security boundary, not the checksum.** The
vault renders what it is about to sign, in full, and a person approves it:
amounts, destinations, change, fee. The digest protects against noise. The
person protects against malice. Neither substitutes for the other, and any
version of this app that hides the details behind a "Sign" button has thrown
away the only defense that matters.

## Fail-closed, enumerated

The collector is written so each of these ends in nothing rather than in the
wrong bytes, and each has a test:

- a frame from a different payload, mid-scan, restarts rather than merges;
- a frame claiming a different total length is rejected, keeping what is good;
- frame number 0, or 4-of-3, is not a frame;
- an unknown payload kind is not a frame;
- a future format version is refused rather than read with today's rules;
- a body that is not base32 is a misread, not bytes;
- an assembled payload whose digest disagrees is thrown away entirely.

## Interoperating with other wallets

Bitcoin has a standard for exactly this, **BC-UR**, spoken by Sparrow,
Electrum, Keystone, Passport and the rest, and it is implemented here in
`src/airgap/ur.ts`. A scanner can tell it apart from our own format at the
first character, so both are readable at once and a person never has to say
which one they are about to show it. `src/airgap/scanner.ts` is that scanner,
and it keeps a collector for each wire running at the same time: giving up on
one animation and pointing the camera at a different wallet should not be a
restart, and there is no reason to make it one.

A single-frame message looks like

```
ur:crypto-psbt/hdonjojkidjyzmadaekpaoaeaeaeaddslyjsemck...
```

and an animated one like

```
ur:crypto-psbt/1-3/lpadaxcsoscyjnbdzevdhdethdonjojkidjy...
ur:crypto-psbt/2-3/lpaoaxcsoscyjnbdzevdhdetaoteurykahae...
```

Three pieces sit under it, and all three are transcriptions of somebody else's
decisions rather than designs of ours:

- **Bytewords**. Bytes as a fixed list of 256 four-letter English words, no
  two sharing both first and last letter, so "minimal" style spends two
  characters a byte and stays inside QR's alphanumeric mode.
- **CBOR**, in a deliberately small subset: unsigned integers, byte strings,
  and one five-item array. Maps, tags, text, floats and indefinite lengths are
  refused, because a signer that accepts a richer grammar than it needs is
  offering a parser to whoever is holding the other screen.
- **A fountain code.** After the first pass, each frame is the XOR of a random
  handful of fragments, chosen by a PRNG both sides seed identically from the
  frame number and the payload checksum. That is what lets a scan that dropped
  frame 5 finish anyway, which matters because a UR animation never comes back
  round to frame 5.

That last one is why the tests are shaped the way they are. Nothing in a mixed
frame says which fragments went into it: get one bit of the PRNG wrong and the
frames still assemble, still pass every checksum, and contain different bytes
than the sender meant. Round-tripping our own encoder through our own decoder
would pass regardless. So the fixtures come from the reference implementation
and the tests compare frame strings character for character.

### The difference between the two formats

**Our own format is not obsolete.** It carries a payload kind on the wire, so
the vault can refuse a thing it does not understand rather than guess, and it
is the one used between the two halves of Labyrinth. BC-UR is what gets spoken
to everybody else.

### Monero

Monero has no standard of its own, but Cake's Cupcake animates wallet2
payloads in BC-UR frames, which means the transport above is the whole
transport. What is *not* pinned down here is the UR type name Cupcake uses for
each payload, so the reader keeps whatever type it was given and hands it up
rather than asserting a name we have not verified against a real device.
Monerujo animates its own format and would need its own reader.

## What this protocol does not do

- **No back channel.** The vault cannot ask for a frame to be repeated,
  because it has no way to speak except by drawing its own code, and the
  companion is not necessarily still looking. Everything is designed around
  scanning until it works.
- **No encryption.** The payloads are public data: an unsigned transaction and
  a signed one are both things you are about to broadcast to the world.
  Encrypting the wire would protect nothing and would add a key-exchange
  problem to a channel whose entire virtue is that it has no state.
- **No authentication of the companion.** See above: the vault assumes the
  transaction in front of it may be hostile, and shows it to you instead.
